![Ghost is a simple, powerful publishing platform that allows you to share your stories with the world.](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/120485/6626501/b2bb072c-c8ff-11e4-8e1a-2e78e68fd5c3.png)

The project is maintained by a non-profit organisation called the **Ghost Foundation**, along with an amazing group of independent [contributors](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/contributors). We're trying to make publishing software that changes the shape of online journalism.

# Staying Up to Date

When a new version of Ghost comes out, you'll want to look over these [upgrade instructions](http://support.ghost.org/how-to-upgrade/) for what to do next.

You can talk to other Ghost users and developers in our [public Slack team](https://ghost.org/slack/) (it's pretty awesome). We have a public meeting every Tuesday at 5:30pm UK time.

New releases are announced on the [dev blog](http://dev.ghost.org/tag/releases/). You can subscribe by email or follow [@TryGhost_Dev](https://twitter.com/tryghost_dev) on Twitter, if you prefer your updates bite-sized and facetious.
